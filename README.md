# ESP12Board
KiCad PCB design for ESP12 projects board.
My first PCB design, my first schematic and my first order at OSH.
Will update this page with my findings when I receive the boards and have tested (burned) them.

## Version 1
The circuit is for running projects, not for programming the ESP, I will program them with Over The Air update support before they go in.

- The jumper JP1 is for deep sleep. 
- The jumper JP2 is for the power LED. 
- 100nF stabilizer. 

## Wishlist next version
Programmable on the board using 5V/3V switching FTDI cable.
Optional integrated buck/boost
Bill of material with links to products
Smaller footprint
Improved layout
